This project is made using:
    - Python
    - Django
    - pokeAPI
    - Bootstrap 5

There are two main forlders:
    - globantWebsite: In this folder the main project is located. Inside we have both main server files and pokeAPI application for this particular project
    - ipython_test: In this folder i put the Jupyter notebok that i use to test the data colletions from pokeAPI

How to run and use the the server:
    - You will need to open a command promt that has Python (in my case i used Python3) and move it inside globantWebsite project's folder
    - Then you can run the command:
        $ python manage.py runserver
      The command promt will be busy from this moment showing the IP that you will have to connect to see the website
    - The main main is page is <localhost>/index so you will have a navigation bar that you can use to move to the HTML code to see the berrie's statistics (it can take about 30 seconds to load the data)
